A neural network made to predict final exam scores of students.

There are three files:
- mlp.py - For training the neural network and predicting the scores
- finalcal.py - For estimating the previous final exam scores based on the grade and internals
- internals.py - For calculating the internal marks for current semester

A neural network with ReLU activation function and Stochastic Gradient Descent as an optimizer (solver) has been used. It has two hidden layers with 5 and 4 nodes respectively.
